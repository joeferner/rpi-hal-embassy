# Changelog

Notable changes to `rpi-hal-embassy`, in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This crate
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A `multicore` feature, for running an executor on cores 1-3 as well as
  core 0, and an `embassy_multicore` example demonstrating one per core.
  The feature adds no code: it selects `rpi-hal`'s cross-core
  `critical-section` implementation, which the driver's shared timer
  queue needs once a second core can reach it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- An `embassy-time` driver over the BCM System Timer, with the tick rate
  pinned to the hardware's fixed 1MHz rather than left to the
  application to choose.
- A thread-mode executor that behaves identically on AArch32 and
  AArch64, supplying its own `__pender` and idle loop rather than taking
  an upstream `platform-*` backend — `platform-cortex-ar` covers only
  AArch32, and `platform-spin` never idles the CPU.
- Examples exercising the driver and executor against real peripherals:
  blink, button, `Instant`/`Duration`, async UART echo, an
  `embassy-net` TCP echo server, and a `picoserve` HTTP server.
