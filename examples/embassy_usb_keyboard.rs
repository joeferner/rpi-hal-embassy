// Reads a USB keyboard through the `embassy-usb-host` stack, running on
// `rpi-hal-embassy`'s `embassy-usb-driver` host controller.
//
// Where rpi-hal's own `usb_hid_keyboard.rs` walks the bus with its
// blocking enumerator and its own HID driver, everything above the
// controller here comes from `embassy-usb-host`: it does the
// enumeration, drives the on-board hub through its `class::hub` driver,
// and decodes reports through `class::kbd`. This crate supplies only the
// bottom layer — `Dwc2HostController` and the pipes it allocates over
// rpi-hal's DWC2 host channels.
//
// Two tasks, and the split is the point:
//
// - `hub_task` owns the bus. It waits for the root port, enumerates
//   whatever is there (on this board the on-board SMSC LAN9514 hub),
//   registers the hub driver, and then services the hub's status-change
//   endpoint forever — so a keyboard plugged in later is found, and one
//   unplugged is noticed.
// - `kbd_task` polls the keyboard's interrupt endpoint and prints what
//   it gets. It is spawned once a keyboard turns up.
//
// Both are live at the same time, each with its own host channel, which
// is what the channel pool exists for: the hub's status endpoint being
// polled cannot stall a key press, or the other way round. Everything
// they wait on is an interrupt — no part of this busy-waits on a USB
// register.
//
// A keyboard in one of the board's physical ports is a full-speed device
// behind a high-speed hub, so its transfers are split transactions
// through the hub's transaction translator, scheduled against the
// start-of-frame interrupt. That is the most demanding path in the
// driver, and it is the one this example runs by default.
