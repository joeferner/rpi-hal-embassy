//! An `embassy-usb-driver` *host* controller over `rpi-hal`'s DWC2
//! host channels, so
//! [`embassy-usb-host`](https://docs.rs/embassy-usb-host)'s enumeration
//! and class drivers run on a Pi.
//!
//! Three types, mirroring the three traits:
//!
//! - [`usb::Dwc2HostController`](crate::usb::Dwc2HostController)
//!   ([`UsbHostController`](embassy_usb_driver::host::UsbHostController))
//!   owns the bus-level operations — waiting for a device on the root
//!   port, and resetting it.
//! - [`usb::Dwc2Allocator`](crate::usb::Dwc2Allocator)
//!   ([`UsbHostAllocator`](embassy_usb_driver::host::UsbHostAllocator))
//!   hands out pipes, one per endpoint, each taking a host channel from
//!   the controller's pool.
//! - [`usb::Dwc2Pipe`](crate::usb::Dwc2Pipe)
//!   ([`UsbPipe`](embassy_usb_driver::host::UsbPipe)) runs the
//!   transfers.
//!
//! # Why this lives here and not in `rpi-hal`
//!
//! `embassy-usb-driver` is trait definitions only, so by the standard
//! this crate's own documentation sets, the adapter would belong in the
//! HAL beside the `embassy-net-driver` one. What moves it here is
//! `embassy-time`: the
//! [`UsbPipe`](embassy_usb_driver::host::UsbPipe) contract is written in
//! wall-clock terms — a control transfer retries a NAK until its
//! [`TimeoutConfig`](embassy_usb_driver::host::TimeoutConfig) expires,
//! an interrupt endpoint re-polls once per `bInterval` *milliseconds* —
//! and `rpi-hal`'s USB layer deliberately has no clock, only bus time
//! (see its `usb::dwc2::asynch`). Somebody has to supply one, and a
//! dependency on `embassy-time` is a dependency on a link-time
//! singleton — exactly the thing this crate exists to keep out of the
//! HAL.
//!
//! So the split is: `rpi-hal` answers "has the hardware finished?", and
//! this module answers "how long are we prepared to wait?".
//!
//! # What an application must provide
//!
//! Beyond [the crate-level requirements](crate), which this inherits:
//!
//! - **The USB interrupt, routed.** `Lic::enable_usb_irq()` at the
//!   interrupt controller, and `rpi_hal::usb::dwc2::on_irq()` called
//!   from the application's `__irq_handler` when `Lic::is_usb_pending()`
//!   reports the line. Nothing here completes without it — every
//!   transfer parks on that interrupt — and since `rpi-hal` supplies
//!   only a weak no-op handler, omitting it looks like a hang at the
//!   first transfer rather than an error.
//! - **The controller and a timer, at `'d`.** Both are borrowed for the
//!   lifetime of the bus. `Dwc2Host` must already be powered up
//!   (`usb::power_on` through the mailbox) and initialised.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! - **A control data stage is capped at
//!   [`MAX_TRANSFER_LEN`](rpi_hal::usb::dwc2::MAX_TRANSFER_LEN)** (256
//!   bytes), the size of the DMA buffer each channel stages transfers
//!   through; a longer one fails with
//!   [`PipeError::BufferOverflow`](embassy_usb_driver::host::PipeError::BufferOverflow).
//!   That covers a boot keyboard's descriptors and the on-board hub's
//!   comfortably, but a composite device with a large configuration
//!   descriptor would need a bigger buffer in the HAL.
//! - **A bulk transfer DMAs straight from the caller's buffer**, so the
//!   buffer must be cache-line aligned and a whole number of cache lines
//!   long; anything else is refused rather than risking a neighbouring
//!   line being discarded by the post-transfer invalidate. Control and
//!   interrupt transfers have no such requirement — they go through the
//!   channel's own aligned buffer.
//! - **Isochronous transfers are not implemented**, the HAL having no
//!   isochronous channel support to build them on.
//! - **Overcurrent is never reported.** The root port's overcurrent
//!   status isn't exposed by the HAL, so
//!   [`DeviceEvent::Overcurrent`](embassy_usb_driver::host::DeviceEvent::Overcurrent)
//!   simply never occurs.
